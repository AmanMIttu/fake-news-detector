## Key Observations

- Sensational vocabulary strongly influences fake news classification.
- Neutral and factual reporting language correlates with real news.
- Explainability methods are necessary to understand automated decisions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that AI systems should not only predict outcomes but also provide transparent reasoning. Interpretable machine learning can support trustworthy decision systems in real-world environments.
